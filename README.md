# f14ddp

Code for the F-14 DDP/DDD pcb 

* Keyboard Maintainer: [NibbledPots](https://github.com/NibbledPots)
* Hardware Supported: F-14DDP pcb [here](https://github.com/NibbledPots/F14-DDP)
* Hardware Availability: you gotta make the pcb yourself, sorry
* Keycodes are currently set to the keybindings I use, but you can change them if you know how

I am in the process of updating the code to fit DCSBios, however, I will still make the QMK code available
